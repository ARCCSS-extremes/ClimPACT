1.X		XX December 2020
* MAJOR UPDATE: Shiny interface is finally released.
* When insufficient data exists for quantile calculations the heatwave aspects HWN and HWF now show up as NA values. Whereas before they were zero which is nonsensical. 
  This means plots are no longer created which is the correct behaviour. Thanks to Guido from Rome.

1.2.8		3 February 2020
* Fixed 2D coordinate variables not always writing out correctly to netCDF.
* Fixed cooling degree days and heating degree day base temperature flags being properly carried through from the wrapper script to the respective functions.

1.2.7		25 April 2019
* Fixed batch script error where the parameters in the batch metadata file relating to rxnday, rnnmm and txdtnd were not being used in the index calculations.
* Fixed error where custom indices specified in the GUI that utilised mean daily temperature (TM) were not being calculated.

1.2.6       10 March 2019
* Edited the command line argument test to fix the need to manually call "startss()" when starting the GUI on Windows systems.
* Minor update of README.

1.2.5       28 February 2019
* Replaced degree symbols in climate.indices.csv with "degrees_C"
* Removed legacy "locally weighted scatterplot smoothing" line from plots generated by the GUI.

1.2.4		23 January 2019
* Empty .csv files are no longer written for indices that are not calculated.
* Missing dates in input file (i.e. missing rows) are now checked for and reported in a text file (ending in "missing_dates"). The user cannot proceed without 
  fixing missing dates, either by filling them in with data or missing values (-99.9).
* Fixed trend information being printed in .csv file for indices that aren't calculated.
* Added a 'Frequency' column to the output trend file to distinguish indices calculated on monthly and annual scales.
* Slight improvement to the writing of error files when running in batch mode.
* Fixed writing out of base period dates in SPEI/SPI thresholds file.
* Minor code clean up.
* Thanks to cicatrixx for feedback.
* This CHANGE LOG was started.
