This document and the body of work it represents was made possible through the efforts of The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) Commission for Climatology (CCl) Open Panel of CCl Experts on Climate Information for Adaptation and Risk Management (OPACE 4) under the guidance of OPACE-4 co-chairs (Rodney Martinez and Andrew Tait); the CCl OPACE 4 Expert Team on Sector-specific Climate Indices (ET-SCI) members: Lisa Alexander (Chair, Australia), Toshiyuki Nakaegawa (co-Chair, Japan), Fatima Zohra El Guelai (Morocco), Amelia Diaz Pablo (Peru), Adam Kalkstein (USA) and GÃ© Verver (The Netherlands) and the WMO World Climate Applications and Services Programme (Rupa Kumar Kolli and Anahit Hovsepyan). It draws heavily on the input of the Expert Team on Climate Risk and Sector-specific Climate Indices (ET-CRSCI), the predecessor of the ET-SCI and including additional ET-CRSCI members Elena Akentyeva, Alexis Nimubona, G. Srinivasan, Philip Thornton, and Peiqun Zhang. Significant contributions to the development of the ET-SCI indices, software and technical manual also came from Nicholas Hannah, Enric Aguilar, Andrew King, James Goldie, Brad Rippey, Sarah Perkins, Sergio M. Vicente-Serrano, Juan Jose Nieto, Sandra Schuster and Hongang Yang. We are also grateful to the other experts and sector representatives who have contributed to the development of indices: Manola Brunet, Albert Klein Tank, Christina Koppe, Sari Kovats, Glenn McGregor, Xuebin Zhang, Javier Sigro, Peter Domonkos, Dimitrios Efthymiadis.

Lisa Alexander, Nicholas Herold and Nicholas Hannah contributed significantly to development of this document, the indices and the Climpact software. The majority of indices in Climpact are calculated using code from the climdex.pcic R package which was developed by the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC). Input was also provided by James Hiebert of PCIC during the development of Climpact.

The application of climate indices to the Agriculture sector was undertaken in full cooperation with the WMO Commission for Agricultural Meteorology, through which Brad Rippey and Sergio Vicente Serrano supported the work.

Commission for Climatology experts Glenn McGregor, Christina Koppe and Sari Kovats supported the applications of indices for Climate and Health, in particular for heat waves and health.

This version of Climpact updates the original Climpact which was based on the RClimDEX software developed by the WMO CCl/WCRP/JCOMM Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). The CCl Co Chair for the CCl OPACE on Climate Monitoring and Assessment (Manola Brunet), ETCCDI members, Albert Klein Tank and Xuebin Zhang, along with Enric Aguilar, Juan Jose Nieto, Javier Sigro, Peter Domonkos, and Dimitrios Efthymiadis, contributed to development of the indices and software described in the previous version of the technical manual.

Climpact is written in R, a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics and makes use of numerous R packages. R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License in source code form.

This work is also supported by WMO grant SSA 3876-12/REM/CNS and the Australian Research Council grant CE110001028 specifically through funding from the New South Wales Office of the Environment and Heritage.
