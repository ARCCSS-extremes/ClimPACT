### About ClimPACT
ClimPACT is an R software package that calculates the [ET-SCI](https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/ccl/opace/opace4/ET-SCI-4-1.php) indices. 

It directly incorporates the R climdex.pcic package to perform most of the calculations. climdex.pcic is available thanks to the efforts of the [Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC)](https://www.pacificclimate.org/).

ClimPACT is a web app which can be run on a personal computer without connecting to the Internet - it simply is displayed through your web browser. ClimPACT is developed at the University of New South Wales.
