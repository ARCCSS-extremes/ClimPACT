### About Climpact
Climpact is an R software package that calculates the [ET-SCI](https://climpact-sci.org/about/project/) indices.

It directly incorporates the R climdex.pcic package to perform most of the calculations. climdex.pcic is available thanks to the efforts of the [Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC)](https://www.pacificclimate.org/).

Climpact is a web app which can be run online or on a personal computer without connecting to the Internet - it is displayed through your web browser. Climpact is developed at the University of New South Wales.
