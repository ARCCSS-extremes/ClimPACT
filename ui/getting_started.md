### Welcome
Climpact is an R software package that calculates the [ET-SCI](https://climpact-sci.org/about/project/) indices.

To start calculating indices for a station text file select **Process single station** on the left-hand side of the screen.

Climpact can also be downloaded and installed on a personal computer or server environment in order to calculate the ET-SCI indices on gridded netCDF data. Get the latest version from the [Climpact GitHub page](https://github.com/ARCCSS-extremes/climpact).

For more help and an introduction to Climpact and the [Expert Team on Sector-specific Climate Indices (ET-SCI)](https://climpact-sci.org/about/project/) view the [user-guide](user_guide/Climpact_user_guide.html).
